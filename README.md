## Ready to shape the future with low power, low latency, offline generative AI
**The M.2 Hailo 8 TPU outperform onchip TPU solutions (iMX95, RK3588…) in performance and upgradability and outperform NVIDIA solutions in power efficiency :**  
– **CM4+Hailo_8 vs Orin Nano 1/2:** Inference Time 13 times lower  
– **CM4+Hailo 8 vs Orin Nano 2/2:** Double FPS and same inference time at 2/3 of the power  
– **Hailo 8 vs Xavier NX :** “Similar performance at a fraction of power consumption and cost”  
– **Hailo 8 vs AGX Xavier :** “NVIDIA solution is more flexible since you can also do training on the platform, while Hailo-8 is only made for low-power inference which it does at 20 times the power efficiency”.  

**The new Asic based M.2 Hailo-10H TPU, expected Q4 2024, outperforms NVIDIA GPU based solution and Intel’s Core Ultra “AI Boost” NPU.**  
“The Hailo-10 brings generative AI to the edge, it can run Llama2-7B with up to 10 tokens per second (TPS) at under 5W of power, while it can generate one image from text in under 5 seconds using Stable Diffusion 2.1 in the same power envelope. Like other many technologies, generative AI is moving from the cloud to the device itself enabling lower latency and offline support”.

## When Ubiquity and scalability meet miniaturization
With its exceptional modularity (3x M.2 modules, 1x CPU module, 2x LPWAN multiprotocol modules), you can tailor the hardware to your needs with two PCB variants :  
The **Model E** includes M.2 modules of 3 types B, E, M and a PCIE 2.0 packet switch :  
- Type M 2230 is reserved for SSD.  
- Type B will be used preferably for cellular communication but can be use also more SSD or advanced positionning.  
- Type E includes a 2-lane PCIE to take full advantage of TPU performance but can be used also for Cellular IoT or advanced positionning.  

The **Model M** includes M.2 modules of 2 types: 1xE and 2xM and a PCIE 3.0 packet switch to take full advantage of SSD performance and the new CM5 and Hailo10H products.  
- Type M 2230 is reserved for an SSD  
- Type B will be used preferably for cellular communication or advanced positionning.  
- Type M 2242 for Hailo 8 or Hailo10H TPU, or more SSD
